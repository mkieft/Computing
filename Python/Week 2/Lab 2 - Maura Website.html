		<h3> About Me </h3> 
		
		My name is <a href="mailto:mkieft@anselm.edu"> Maura Kieft </a> I'm from Denver, Colorado.  
		I have a twin brother named Liam and an older brother named Charlie who both still live in Colorado with my parents. I'm very tall, have two tattoos, and I have been told
		that it is impossible for me to be mean to someone, which I definitely have taken as a compliment. I dye my hair when I get stressed out so don't be surprised if you see me with multiple hair colors a month.  I think that art is one of the most important parts of the world and that everyone has a beautiful creative side to them, and the world needs 
		this art to thrive. Because of this I think school's need to make art a more important part of the curriculum.

		I play ice hockey for Saint Anselm College, a sport which I have been playing since I was three years old. I also
		enjoy a passion for music, so I frequently attend concerts in my free time, and I've seen over 300 artists live.

		<br> I'm a Computer Science major and one day I hope to work alongside musicians and develop programs specifically for music and performance.  
		<br>
		A Liberal Art education is important to me for many reasons, but by far the msot is having the oppurtunity to study so many different subjects rather than just my major. I've taken a Greek class and a Philosophy class that have both 
		openned up my mind to the world.
