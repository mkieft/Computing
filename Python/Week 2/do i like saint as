	<h2> I don't like Saint Anselm College, I <b> LOVE </b> it. </h2>
	
	<hr> 
	
	Whether it be because of the liberal arts education, the community, or even the location, there's just so much that goes into making this school an amazing place for me. 
	Every person I have met here actually enjoys being at this school; which is interesting to me because every school I've been to before was not like that.
	The classroom ratio is impeccable and I'm able to actually learn as well as get the personal assistance I desire. 
	
	If there's any school that's the best fit for me, it's <b> Saint Anselm College </b>
