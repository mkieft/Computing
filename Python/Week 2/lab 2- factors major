		<Title> Factors of my Major decision </title>
		<h1> The Factors Which Pushed Me Towards Computer Science </h1> 
		<body bgcolor="#BEFEF7">
			There were many factors that had led me to the Computer Science Major but I think I would have to attribute my decision to my young self learning computers early and 
			being continuously curious about the way in which they work. I enjoyed (and still enjoy) making videos on computers. I started off by using windows movie maker, moved to iMovie, and finally am using
			Final Cut Pro. Everything about computers fascinates me and luckily I have a fun time learning about them. A lot of people can't say that about their majors.
			So, ultimately, I made this decision based upon the fact that I think I could enjoy learning more about computer science and hopefully obtaining a job in the field.
